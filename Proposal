Scope
Scope refers to the defined boundaries of a project. This part outlines what the project will deliver the timeline, and the resources involved. 

Scope: Our team is committed to developing an application designed to foster social connections among college and university students. This application will not only serve as a platform for building relationships but also as a tool for educational advancement. We aim to create a supportive community where freedom of speech is upheld and respected. Our goal is to enhance the academic and social experiences of students through this innovative platform. 

Deliverables: 
Profile Creation: users can create personalized profiles, showcasing their academic interests, hobbies and more when needed. 

Community Forums: A platform for students to engage in discussions, share ideas for their study or projects, ask questions regarding academic and provide answers. 

Direct Messaging: Enables private conversations between users, facilitating one to one interactions. 

Study Group: Allows users to create and join study groups based on their courses or interests. Furthermore, this can be project development discussion. 

Event Calendar: A feature to keep track of important academic dates, social events, and study group meetings.

Resource Sharing: A platform for sharing educational resources like notes, textbooks. 

New Feed: Updates or news from the university, student organizations and peers. 

Exclusions: 

Physical Meetups: Organizing physical meetups or events might be beyond the scope of this application. The app is primarily designed for online interaction.
Personal Counselling or Therapy: While the app can provide a platform for students to share their experiences and support each other, it should not be seen as a replacement for professional mental health services.

Academic Grading or Evaluation: The app should not be used for official academic grading or evaluation. Itâ€™s a platform for social and educational support, not formal education.

Constraints
Constraints refers to any limitations or constraints, design constraints, usability, performance, documentation, packaging, etc. 

User Privacy and Data Security: As our app will be handling personal data of students such as student ID, we must comply with data protection regulations. 

Accessibility: Our app should be accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. This means that our app should comply with accessibility standards. 

Internet Connectivity: Not all students will have access to high-speed internet. Our app should be optimized to work well even in low-bandwidth situations. 

Budgets: Our project will be working with low or no budgets as this is a class project. This would limit our choices for technology, features and other aspects of the project. 

Scalability: If our app becomes popular, we should be able to handle numerous users without performance issues. 

Device Compatibility: Students may use a variety of devices and operating systems, such as Android, iOS. Our app should be compatible with all possible platforms.
