Introduction:
Students who have graduated from secondary school are experiencing an environment that is completely different from the secondary educational system. In addition to that, freshmen and introverted students tend to miss out on many of the opportunities and information provided by the college or university. Our main goal is to aim for a convenient and valuable school life for all college students.


Business Opportunity:
	In BC, we feel that many universities do not offer a media that’s dedicated to university students. University staff still use papers, posters, emails, and a third-party platform that plans out events for them. Even the university students who run events use the same platforms to contact their students. Imagine yourself being in three different clubs and a student union, if they use all different platforms to contact their students, it would be difficult to keep track of all events and keep in touch with them. 
 	Popular platforms that students use are Facebook, Reddit, Rate my Professor(courses), and Discord. Facebook is used for group chats and group postings; Reddit is used to share the ideas and school information; Rate my professor is used to see what style the professor is like and whether he/she fits with my study style; Discord has multi-chat and call service that is adequate for club where you need to distinguish specific topics. Every group of students or individual students is required to use those aspects of the platform, but such platforms aren't provided. 
	To solve the problems mentioned above, we came up with an idea of creating a student dedicated platform.  We expect that a small number of students will be using the application in the beginning stage but as students notice the benefit of this product, there will be a significant increase in the product. 



Stakeholder: (Identification of the primary users and nonuser stakeholders of the software, their high-level goals (needs/expectations), their problems, and possibly the current solutions to their problems)
•	Server Host: Application needs a server to host University student’s friendly platform. 
•	Developers: A team of developers who are going to implement an application 
•	Staff in college and university:
o	Application requires:  
	Student’s information for log in process
	Course information
	What this course requires from students.
	Textbook 
	Pre-requisites
	Previous Student’s feedback 
	When the course is offered for timetable creation 
	Instructor’s information
	What students should expect from him/her. 
•	Staff need to provide and promote events happening at school. 
•	Companies 
•	If they want to advertise their company and positions as well as internship. 
Primary Users:
•	Students 
•	New students need a hub or place to find information about the university community. 
•	Existing students need a hub or place to keep in touch with events in school. 


•	Clubs 
•	These are their primary requirements to run a club.
	Provide general information about their club and promote it.
	Working on a project. 
	Club needs a hub to host a group of people online; discord and Facebook group are used but they are not perfectly suitable for scholar usage. 


Vision/Statement Position Statement 
	
We are designing a scholar community-based application for university students in BC. We’ve divided our users into two types of users; a group of university students(AKA GUS) and individual students whether they are new to university or existing. In many universities, implementing a healthy community is considered hard. Users use many different platforms, and there are limited ways to approach other users in person. 

This is what makes our platform unique. Our platform offers a variety of ways for the users to interact with each other and not just that, to easily interact with their scholar materials.  Our application offers a platform that is essential for GUS, such as new feed, event notification, study groups finder, and multi chat system. Not only that, but we also offer class schedule maker, course feedback from previous students who have taken the subject, and job offers from companies which most individual students would look after. 


Once its system is implemented in BC University/college’s community, it can further develop into a Canada National wide community website that creates a positive influence for students. We expect that our application will be a center of university student’s meeting place.
