Introduction:
Students who have graduated from secondary school are experiencing an environment that is completely different from the secondary educational system. In addition to that, freshmen and introverted students tend to miss out on many of the opportunities and information provided by the college or university. Our main goal is to aim for a convenient and valuable school life for all college students.
