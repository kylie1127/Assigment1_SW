Introduction:
Students who have graduated from secondary school are experiencing an environment that is completely different from the secondary educational system. In addition to that, freshmen and introverted students tend to miss out on many of the opportunities and information provided by the college or university. Our main goal is to aim for a convenient and valuable school life for all college students.


Business Opportunity/ Problem Statement:
	In BC, we feel that many universities do not offer a media that’s dedicated to university students. University staff still use papers, posters, emails, and a third-party platform that plans out events for them. Even the university students who run events use the same platforms to contact their students. Imagine yourself being in three different clubs and a student union, if they use all different platforms to contact their students, it would be difficult to keep track of all events and keep in touch with them. 
 	Popular platforms that students use are Facebook, Reddit, Rate my Professor(courses), and Discord. Facebook is used for group chats and group postings; Reddit is used to share the ideas and school information; Rate my professor is used to see what style the professor is like and whether he/she fits with my study style; Discord has multi-chat and call service that is adequate for club where you need to distinguish specific topics. Every group of students or individual students is required to use those aspects of the platform, but such platforms aren't provided. 
	To solve the problems mentioned above, we came up with an idea of creating a student dedicated platform.  We expect that a small number of students will be using the application in the beginning stage but as students notice the benefit of this product, there will be a significant increase in the product. 



Stakeholder: (Identification of the primary users and nonuser stakeholders of the software, their high-level goals (needs/expectations), their problems, and possibly the current solutions to their problems)
•	Server Host: Application needs a server to host University student’s friendly platform. 
•	Developers: A team of developers who are going to implement an application 
•	Staff in college and university:
o	Application requires:  
	Student’s information for log in process
	Course information
	What this course requires from students.
	Textbook 
	Pre-requisites
	Previous Student’s feedback 
	When the course is offered for timetable creation 
	Instructor’s information
	What students should expect from him/her. 
•	Staff need to provide and promote events happening at school. 
•	Companies 
•	If they want to advertise their company and positions as well as internship. 
Primary Users:
•	Students 
•	New students need a hub or place to find information about the university community. 
•	Existing students need a hub or place to keep in touch with events in school. 


•	Clubs 
•	These are their primary requirements to run a club.
	Provide general information about their club and promote it.
	Working on a project. 
	Club needs a hub to host a group of people online; discord and Facebook group are used but they are not perfectly suitable for scholar usage. 


Vision/Statement Position Statement 
	
We are designing a scholar community-based application for university students in BC. We’ve divided our users into two types of users; a group of university students(AKA GUS) and individual students whether they are new to university or existing. In many universities, implementing a healthy community is considered hard. Users use many different platforms, and there are limited ways to approach other users in person. 

This is what makes our platform unique. Our platform offers a variety of ways for the users to interact with each other and not just that, to easily interact with their scholar materials.  Our application offers a platform that is essential for GUS, such as new feed, event notification, study groups finder, and multi chat system. Not only that, but we also offer class schedule maker, course feedback from previous students who have taken the subject, and job offers from companies which most individual students would look after. 


Once its system is implemented in BC University/college’s community, it can further develop into a Canada National wide community website that creates a positive influence for students. We expect that our application will be a center of university student’s meeting place.


Scope
Scope refers to the defined boundaries of a project. This part outlines what the project will deliver the timeline, and the resources involved. 

Scope: Our team is committed to developing an application designed to foster social connections among college and university students. This application will not only serve as a platform for building relationships but also as a tool for educational advancement. We aim to create a supportive community where freedom of speech is upheld and respected. Our goal is to enhance the academic and social experiences of students through this innovative platform. 

Deliverables: 
Profile Creation: users can create personalized profiles, showcasing their academic interests, hobbies and more when needed. 

Community Forums: A platform for students to engage in discussions, share ideas for their study or projects, ask questions regarding academic and provide answers. 

Direct Messaging: Enables private conversations between users, facilitating one to one interactions. 

Study Group: Allows users to create and join study groups based on their courses or interests. Furthermore, this can be project development discussion. 

Event Calendar: A feature to keep track of important academic dates, social events, and study group meetings.

Resource Sharing: A platform for sharing educational resources like notes, textbooks. 

New Feed: Updates or news from the university, student organizations and peers. 

Exclusions: 

Physical Meetups: Organizing physical meetups or events might be beyond the scope of this application. The app is primarily designed for online interaction.
Personal Counselling or Therapy: While the app can provide a platform for students to share their experiences and support each other, it should not be seen as a replacement for professional mental health services.

Academic Grading or Evaluation: The app should not be used for official academic grading or evaluation. It’s a platform for social and educational support, not formal education.

Constraints
Constraints refers to any limitations or constraints, design constraints, usability, performance, documentation, packaging, etc. 

User Privacy and Data Security: As our app will be handling personal data of students such as student ID, we must comply with data protection regulations. 

Accessibility: Our app should be accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. This means that our app should comply with accessibility standards. 

Internet Connectivity: Not all students will have access to high-speed internet. Our app should be optimized to work well even in low-bandwidth situations. 

Budgets: Our project will be working with low or no budgets as this is a class project. This would limit our choices for technology, features and other aspects of the project. 

Scalability: If our app becomes popular, we should be able to handle numerous users without performance issues. 

Device Compatibility: Students may use a variety of devices and operating systems, such as Android, iOS. Our app should be compatible with all possible platforms. 



Key Features and Functionalities:

1.Anonymous community:  required where users can freely write and share their opinions. This facilitates communication and information sharing among the school community.
- Anonymity: Anonymity must be ensured so that students can share their opinions freely. This creates an environment where users can have honest and open conversations.
2.Timetable and lecture reviews: Students need the ability to check their timetable and lecture reviews so they would consider those reviews for creating their timetables.In addition,once a student is on a waitlist, they could communicate through community whether somebody is going to drop that course or not and it gives students to make changes efficiently.
3.Club recruitment: provide an introduction to each department and club. This would help students choose the department or club that suits them.
4.Cafeteria: link with boost.
